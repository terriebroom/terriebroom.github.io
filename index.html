        Growing up, she learned very quickly and mastered the visual and performing arts.

        <p style="text-align:center;">  
        She would re-create images of her favourite comic characters,
        and drum up fictiscious characters from her vivid and wide child-like imagination.

        Travelling is a favourite hobby of Bloom's, meeting new people and learning about new cultures.
        So far, she has lived and worked in three countries.
