        <p style="text-align:center;">Hello and welcome! This is a story of the Mid Autumn Bloom. Born in warm mid November, Bloom was made to be an early bloomer.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
        Growing up, she learned very quickly and mastered the visual and performing arts.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">  
        She would re-create images of her favourite comic characters,
        and drum up fictiscious characters from her vivid and wide child-like imagination.
